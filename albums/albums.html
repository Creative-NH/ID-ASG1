                <p>Queen's debut album was recorded in London between 1971 and 1972 at Trident Studios and De Lane Lea studios. All but one of the tracks were produced by Queen, Roy Baker and Trident's resident producer John Anthony, with <i>The Night Comes Down</i> instead produced by the band and Louie Austin at De Lane Studios. The engineers for the sessions were Roy Baker, Mike Stone, Ted Sharpe and David Hentschel.</p>
                <p>The cover artwork was devised by Brian, Freddie and photographer friend Douglas Puddifoot and is based upon a shot taken on stage by Puddifoot during an early Queen concert. The band members thought the image of Freddie performing beneath a lone spot-light was an appropriate cover for the first album.</p>
                <p>This album saw the beginning of the famous 'Nobody played synths' note, which was to become such a familiar aspect of all Queen LPs right up to 1980's <i>The Game</i>. The band were fed up with people mistaking their elaborate multi-tracking and innovative guitar effects for synthesizers, when in fact much of the sound was created by Brian on his guitar using the band's own equipment and pioneering recording techniques - including the John designed 'Deacy amp' which is still used to this day.</p>
                <p>The famous Queen Crest logo seen on the back of the first album was designed by Freddie around this time, and became a familiar sight on most of the band's product.</p>
                <p>Queen was released on July 13th 1973 in the UK attained Gold sales status. In America it was issued in September, with a revised pink cover replacing the usual purple one, and also reached Gold sales.</p>
                <p>Singles from this album: <i>Keep Yourself Alive</i> / <i>Liar</i>.</p>

                <p><b>“To me, Queen II was the sort of emotional music we’d always wanted to be able to play, although we couldn’t play most of it onstage because it was too complicated”.<br>- Brian May</b></p>
                <p>Queen's second album was produced by Robin Geoffrey Cable, Roy Thomas Baker and Queen, and engineered by the ever-resourceful Mike Stone. Recorded at London's Trident Studios in August 1973, the band were at last permitted to use the studio during normal hours and, unlike the first album, take proper time to experiment with the myriad of ideas they had for new techniques, textures and sounds. Finally, Queen could record an album how they wanted, when they wanted, and without the limitations imposed upon them throughout the debut work.</p>
                <p>Numerous problems beset the album's release. Not least, its completion coincided with the 1973 oil crisis and consequently government-enforced measures for energy conservation delayed its manufacture by several months. Furthermore, when the first pressing arrived in record shops, the band noticed a spelling error on the sleeve and complained persistently before it was finally corrected.</p>
                <p>The album cover concept was based on a photograph of Marlene Dietrich that Freddie had seen, and Mick Rock was brought in to achieve a similar effect. The image has since become one of the most recognisable and frequently used of the band, and is as striking today as it was in the 1970s.</p>
                <p>In contrast to this iconic predominantly black portrait of Queen, the inner gatefold photograph features the band in equally grand attire, but this time dressed in white, against a white backdrop. The theme was continued inside the album too, for instead of the usual Side 1 and 2, the original <i>Queen II</i> LP comprised Side White and Side Black, each one representing the band members' individual song writing talents. Freddie's contributions to the album, including the majestic <i>March Of The Black Queen</i>, would occupy Side Black, while Roger's track for the album, and all of Brian's, including <i>White Queen</i>, were presented on Side White. John had not yet begun his song writing for Queen - his first composition would follow later in 1974, on the <i>Sheer Heart Attack</i> LP. The Black/White theme was a major part of Queen in 1974, not just on record or in terms of artwork and design, but on stage too, in terms of costume.</p>
                <p>Queen II was released on March 8th 1974, coinciding with an extensive UK tour that began at the start of the month. It would eventually climb to No 5 in the UK chart, helped considerably by constant touring, the band’s first hit single <i>Seven Seas Of Rhye</i> (released two weeks earlier) and their first appearances on the BBC's Top Of The Pops television show. The album gave Queen their first UK/USA Gold status LP.</p>

                <p><b>“The album is very varied. We took it to extreme I suppose. We are very interested in studio techniques and wanted to use what was available.”<br>- Freddie Mercury</b></p>
                <p>Queen's third studio album was recorded between July and September 1974 at four different studios in England and Wales and was produced by Queen and Roy Thomas Baker, with once again Mike Stone as engineer.</p>
                <p>Somewhat of a departure from the first two albums, <i>Sheer Heart Attack</i> had much more of a group feel about it, a coherence not possible to achieve previously because of the erratic way in which its predecessors were recorded. The first album, for example, was famously recorded in 'downtime' with the band permitted to use Trident studios only when no one else was using it. This album by contrast was recorded without those distractions in more calm and orthodox conditions and ultimately gave rise to a strong and greatly diverse piece of work containing several of the band's best-loved classics. This was much more of an accomplishment than might be apparent, given that Brian was absent from many sessions due to contracting Hepatitis while on tour in America in May and only being available to record his guitar and vocal parts relatively late in the proceedings. It was far from ideal but none of this is evident on the final work, and more than forty years on the album remains a firm favourite among Queen devotees. It has consistently been voted in the top 5 favourite albums in fan polls.</p>
                <p><i>Sheer Heart Attack</i> is a more pop orientated work than its two predecessors, and indeed <i>Killer Queen</i> was the song that provided the band with the international hit and acclaim that <i>Seven Seas Of Rhye</i> never quite achieved. Brian would later observe, “For some strange reason we seemed to get a rather different feel on <i>Sheer Heart Attack</i> because of the way we were forced to record it (referring to his illness) and even allowing for all the problems we had, none of us were really displeased with the final result. “Roger, “It's my favourite. It holds together very well. It's much more concise. It's very varied and dynamic. The different sounds were pleasing.”</p>
                <p><i>Killer Queen</i> is the best known song on the album, for which Freddie would later be awarded his first Ivor Novello award, and also featured is <i>Stone Cold Crazy</i>, the first Queen song credited to all four band members, and one of the very first songs the band experimented with in the earliest rehearsals and shows. Brian’s <i>Now I’m Here</i> is present too, which would be issued as a single, as too is John’s first composition for Queen, <i>Misfire</i>. Roger’s hard-paced <i>Sheer Heart Attack</i>, although intended for this album was never finished in time and so appeared much later - on <i>News Of The World</i> in 1977</p>
                <p>Like <i>Queen II</i>, the front cover image was photographed by Queen's good friend Mick Rock - the man of whom it was said, 'captured the 70s'. To achieve the unique look we see on the cover, the band members were smeared in Vaseline and then sprayed with water to achieve a very particular and some might say 'odd' look. Nevertheless, it had the desired effect, as the <i>Sheer Heart Attack</i> cover is both (cardiac) arresting and memorable.</p>
                <p><i>Sheer Heart Attack</i> was released on November 8th 1974 and reached No 2 in the UK, achieving Gold status. It would be the first Queen album to reach the Top 20 in the USA, achieving a very impressive No 12 position and also earning Gold status.</p>
                <p>Singles from this album: <i>Killer Queen</i> / <i>Flick Of The Wrist</i> / <i>Now I’m Here</i> / <i>Tenement Funster</i> (on <i>Queen’s First EP</i>).</p>

                <p><b>“We had done some really serious, epic videos in the past, and we just wanted people to know that we didn’t take ourselves too seriously, that we could still laugh at ourselves. I think we proved that.”<br>- Roger Taylor on I Want To Break Free</b>></p>
                <p>When their eleventh studio album <i>The Works</i> - produced by Queen and Mack - was released in the UK on February 27th 1984, fans and critics alike hailed it as Queen return to their rock roots and to the traditional Queen sound absent on the previous album. Record Mirror described it as ‘Another jewel in the crown’.</p>
                <p>For the first time ever the band started the new recordings in Los Angeles in August 1983 and finished at Musicland studios in Germany early the following year. The album cover was conceived by Queen and features an image from a photographic session with legendary Hollywood photographer, the late George Hurrell, who had previously photographed Marilyn Monroe and many other Hollywood greats.</p>
                <p>Roger's <i>Radio Ga Ga</i> was the first single to be released from the album, reaching No 2 in the UK and No 1 in nineteen other countries around the world. This was the first time a Queen single had featured its own personal catalogue number - QUEEN 1.</p>
                <p><i>The Works</i> album, the first from Queen in nearly two years, entered the UK chart at No 2. It reached No 1 in Portugal and Holland and the Top 10 everywhere else around the world, and achieved Platinum status in the UK and Gold in the USA.</p>

                <p><b>“It's the perfect theatrical epitaph for a life dedicated to gorgeous artifice.”<br>- Entertainment Weekly</b></p>
                <p>Queen's 15th studio album was also, tragically, their last with Freddie.</p>
                <p>Following his death in November 1991, John, Roger and Brian spent the next four years working sporadically on a new project with the vocal recordings left behind by Freddie. It was a difficult and enormously challenging process on many levels, unprecedented in terms of personal anguish, but when <i>Made In Heaven</i> emerged it quickly established itself as one of Queen's finest and most accomplished pieces of work.</p>
                <p><i>Made In Heaven</i> was recorded at Mountain Studios in Montreux Switzerland and was produced by Queen. It was co produced and engineered by David Richards, with assistance from Justin Shirley-Smith and Joshua J. Macrae. The album title dates back to a track on Freddie's first solo album in 1985, which the band had reworked for this project.</p>
                <p>Despite being told by his doctors in 1989 that he might not be around long enough to finish <i>The Miracle</i>, Freddie did finish it, and indeed he completed the next project too, <i>Innuendo</i>, in 1991. His health and physical condition was severely compromised throughout the sessions, but through innumerable difficulties he remained focused and determined to record more and more vocals until he could record no more. It was his wish that wherever possible, and particularly in terms of work, that things carry on as normal. The first half of 1991 saw an unusual period of recording like no other in the band's career, governed largely by Freddie and his failing health.</p>
                <p>Brian: “By the time we were recording these tracks we'd had the discussions and knew that we were totally on borrowed time. So our plan was to just make full use of Freddie as much as possible. We basically lived in the studio for a while and he would call and say, 'I can come in for a few hours today'. Our plan was just to make as much use of him as we could. He said, 'Get me to sing anything. Write me anything and I will sing it. I will give it my ALL. I will leave you as much material as I possibly can'.”</p>
                <p>Roger: “Freddie knew his time was limited and he really wanted to work and to keep going. He felt that that was the best way to keep his spirits up, and he wanted to leave as much as possible. We certainly agreed, so we backed him up right to the hilt.</p>
                <p>“With <i>The Miracle</i> he wasn't that well, but he wasn't that ill. And that was more of an effort, a bit of a long album to make. But for <i>Innuendo</i>, he really wasn't very well. I think there are some extraordinary performances on that one. I find it a very strong album all the way through. It's quite emotional.”</p>
                <p>No-one knew when or even if Freddie would return for more recordings, or which session would be his last. The entire recording process was, to borrow from a Freddie song title, very much in the lap of the gods.</p>
                <p>Brian: “A lot of it was really, strangely enough, quite joyous. It sounds odd to say that, and people are going to hate me for saying it, but I know Freddie had some very good times in those last periods. It was tough, but there was a lot of joy during the final recordings. Freddie did not let it become downbeat. He was always 'Up' if he was in the recording studio, always full of ideas, enthusiasm and great passion.”</p>
                <p>Roger: “I think the last thing that he wanted was to draw attention to any kind of weakness or frailty - which was all too obvious anyway. He didn't want any kind of pity or anything like that, and he was incredibly brave about the whole thing.”</p>
                <p>Brian: “I never saw him let it all get on top of him, never ever. He would always just get on with things. And we had some very funny times. We were very focused and very together as a group. I think we all realised how precious those moments possibly were going to be.”</p>
                <p>Sadly, the inevitable time came when Freddie could work no more. He had recorded his final sessions and never attended the studio again. The last recordings of Freddie were in the can, for the rest of Queen to work their collective magic upon when they felt able to. Now, with strict instructions from Freddie, it was up to John, Brian and Roger to complete the songs and album without their beloved colleague.</p>
                <p>In addition to brand new material, the <i>Made In Heaven</i> album also features tracks from Freddie's solo career, but in radically revised fashion; re-worked, but with all the familiar distinctive Queen trademarks and production techniques evident from beginning to end.</p>
                <p>The album cover concept by Queen and Richard Gray features the even more larger than life Freddie statue (sculpted by Irena Sedlecka) overlooking Lake Geneva in Switzerland, in a sumptuous sunrise setting - the place at which Freddie had written and recorded his last songs, and which had so inspired and influenced him. The gatefold sleeve reveals a similar view but this time taken at sunset.</p>
                <p>The statue is now a permanent fixture by the lake, with Freddie standing proud, purveyor of a spectacular landscape and the many people that come to visit him there. The effigy is every bit as imposing as Freddie was on stage and has become a great tourist attraction. Queen's inimitable front man stands tall, overseeing the view he himself enjoyed so much and indeed captured in the lyrics of one of his final songs, <i>A Winter's Tale</i>; swans floating by, sea-gulls flying over, a silky moon up in the sky, mountains zoomin' higher, quiet and peaceful, tranquil and blissful, a kind of magic in the air, a truly magnificent view, a breathtaking scene, an extraordinary place!</p>
                <p><i>Made In Heaven</i> was released on November 6th 1995 and was promoted as 'The breathtaking final album'. Most significantly of all, John, Brian and Roger concluded the sleeve credits with, 'Dedicated to the immortal spirit of Freddie Mercury'.</p>
                <p>It became an instant favourite with the fans and gave Queen their most successful studio album to date. It immediately went to No 1 in the UK, as well as Austria, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Italy, Holland, New Zealand, Poland, Portugal, Sweden, Switzerland and Spain. It achieved multiple Platinum sales status all around the world and would eventually sell in excess of 20 million copies.</p>
                <p>Singles from this album: <i>Heaven For Everyone</i> / <i>A Winter’s Tale</i> / <i>Too Much Love Will Kill You</i> / <i>Let Me Live</i> / <i>You Don’t Fool Me</i>.</p>
