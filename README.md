# QueenOnline Revamped
This project aims to revamp the existing website of the rock band Queen as its website has much to be improved on in terms of its visuals and user experience, so as to meet the needs of its users, primarily the fans of the band.

## Design Process
I believe that the sections, "Music" and "Live", of the website have the greatest significance. Thus, I decided to choose them, as well as the home page, as the pages I would work on in my project. As I felt that the "Shop" section has no room for improvisation, I decided to omit it from my webpage.
I decided to improve on certain areas where users of the original site might find lacking, and to implement several features I identified that could help visitors achieve their goals, as the section below elaborates. For example, the homepage is cluttered with an unorganized collage of news articles with no gaps in between one another, resulting in an unpleasant viewing experience. Furthermore, in the mobile version of the page, the main focus of the page is reduced to a quarter of its original size, causing it to appear less striking.
### User Stories
#### As a fan of the band, in order to avoid missing out on upcoming events, I want to easily view new events or updates on the band.
The revamped website places greater emphasis on the central content of the homepage by pinning it and allocating a third of the space in the page, ensuring a visually appealing balance between the main content and the news articles. Furthermore, individual articles are given greater emphasis through the additon of a border around the grid of articles.

#### As an aspiring musician, I want to learn more about the band's albums as it could provide me with inspiration.
The revamped website centralizes the band's album covers to achieve an effect of greater focus. When clicked on, they expand, showing users the details and history of these albums. In the original site, a spotify playlist is embedded into the site to serve as a sample. I decided to replace it with a youtube playlist containing the full album instead, as it provides fans with a more immersive experience.

#### As a fan of the band, I want to register for events such as concerts and meetups conveniently so I can attend them.
The original site displays information about live events through rows containing the date, country and venue name. While it is an efficient and organized method of displaying information, it is visually unappealing and has insufficient details on the events. Thus, the revamped website contains a plethora of squares in a grid that provides users with the aforementioned info at first glance. Clicking on them opens another page containing further details on the event.
