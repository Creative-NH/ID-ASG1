# QueenOnline Revamped
This project aims to revamp the existing website of the rock band Queen as its website has much to be improved on in terms of its visuals and user experience, so as to meet the needs of its users, primarily the fans of the band.

## Design Process
I believe that the sections, "Music" and "Live", of the website have the greatest significance. Thus, I decided to choose them, as well as the home page, as the pages I would work on in my project. As I felt that the "Shop" section has no room for improvisation, I decided to omit it from my webpage.
I decided to improve on certain areas where users of the original site might find lacking, and to implement several features I identified that could help visitors achieve their goals, as the section below elaborates. For example, the homepage is cluttered with an unorganized collage of news articles with no gaps in between one another, resulting in an unpleasant viewing experience. Furthermore, in the mobile version of the page, the main focus of the page is reduced to a quarter of its original size, causing it to appear less striking.
### User Stories
#### As a fan of the band, in order to avoid missing out on upcoming events, I want to easily view new events or updates on the band.
The revamped website places greater emphasis on the central content of the homepage by pinning it and allocating a third of the space in the page, ensuring a visually appealing balance between the main content and the news articles. Furthermore, individual articles are given greater emphasis through the additon of a border around the grid of articles.

#### As an aspiring musician, I want to learn more about the band's albums as it could provide me with inspiration.
The revamped website centralizes the band's album covers to achieve an effect of greater focus. When clicked on, they expand, showing users the details and history of these albums. In the original site, a spotify playlist is embedded into the site to serve as a sample. I decided to replace it with a youtube playlist containing the full album instead, as it provides fans with a more immersive experience.

#### As a fan of the band, I want to register for events such as concerts and meetups conveniently so I can attend them.
The original site displays information about live events through rows containing the date, country and venue name. While it is an efficient and organized method of displaying information, it is visually unappealing and has insufficient details on the events. Thus, the revamped website contains a plethora of squares in a grid that provides users with the aforementioned info at first glance. Clicking on them opens another page containing further details on the event.

## Features
### Existing Features
#### Homepage
- Banner spanning a third of the page - Allows users to view important site content at first glance. Would direct users to sign-up page had it existed.
- Two rows of boxes containing article content - Takes up the remainder of the page, each taking another third. Contains links to articles on the actual site, allowing fans to stay in the know on the band.

#### Events
- Boxes containing event details - Displays date and location of each event. Expands when hovered upon to signify that clicking on it reveals further details on the event.
- Popup - When a box is clicked on, it triggers a popup containing a YouTube video and a description of the event, as well as a button for users to register as a member. This popup is coupled with an overlay that obscures the main site content, so as to bring attention to the popup content. Clicking on the 'X' or the overlay closes the popup.

#### Albums
- Album Covers - Allow users to view the album covers associated with each album. Expands when hovered upon, signifying that clicking on it reveals information on the album. A YouTube playlist of the album, as well as commentary on the album are displayed under the album cover when it is clicked on.
### Features Left to Implement
I originally intended to create a fourth page, a forms page, in order to enable users to sign up for events. However, due to time constraints, this feature will be implemented in the future.
## Technologies Used
-
## Testing
### Homepage
On desktop, the banner takes up the first third of the page vertically, while the two columns of boxes take up the other two thirds. On mobile, the banner instead takes up the last third of the page horizontally, and the two columns are combined into one.
### Events
The desktop display shows several rows of boxes.
On the mobile display, these rows are replaced with a singular column. Furthermore, both the container containing the main content and the popup have an increased width, taking up a greater proportion of the page.
### Albums
The desktop and mobile displays are almost identical - The only difference is that the container containing the main content takes up a greater proportion of the page.
### Bugs/Problems
One issue I faced was that the promo image in the homepage covers site content on screens with widths ranging from 1001px to 1330px
